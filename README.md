# Starting iOS Development FAQ

Welcome to the Starting iOS Development FAQ. I see people who are new to iOS development asking the same questions repeatedly in forums. Some of these questions include the following:

* Do I need a Mac?
* What Mac should I get?
* Does Xcode run on iPads?
* Should I learn SwiftUI or UIKit?
* Where do I learn iOS development?

I am gathering and organizing answers to these frequently asked questions here.

Currently the best way to contribute to this FAQ is to share it when someone asks a question on a forum or Slack room that has an answer here.
